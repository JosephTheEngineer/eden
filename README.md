# Eden Development
We are developing Eden World Builder, a block based building game created by Ari Ronen for iOS.

## Current Project
We are currently working on version 2.1.1. This update will include:
* New texture for vine block.
* Increased brightness of lamps.
* iTunes file sharing for easily copying worlds to and from your computer.
* Made door noises quieter.
* Made fire slightly bigger, and burn for longer.
* New launch screen
* Minor bug fixes and code modernizations.
* More creatures can exist in one world.
* Small changes to world gen. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Setting up local repo

Use the Terminal command `git clone https://github.com/JosephTheEngineer/Eden.git` to download the existing repo to your home folder. You will also need to download the "Flurry" folder from this link: https://mega.nz/#!cDQ1SKKA!0G7USvZ3Yf79QOQ6u-Gjn8G7kTNyJ8sAMcqeRy9n3q0, unzip it, and place it inside /Eden/iOS.

### Uploading your local repo

After you are done making changes cd into ~/Eden using `cd ~/Eden` then type `git add .` to add the changes to the resolve, then commit your changes and add a reason with `git commit -m "INSERT REASON HERE"` and finally upload with `git push -u origin master`. You can also commit using Xcode's built in Source Control features.
